    <string name="fDescr">The China Roses have a mysterious origin. Although there is no evidence of how they were developed, they are the product of a rich culture of ingenious people.
                            They were not seen in art before the tenth century, were not a part of mythology, and little is known of their history.
                            What we do know is that they were cultivated for many centuries in China; however, the Chinese did not prize the rose as they did the chrysanthemum, which appears in their art from long times past.
